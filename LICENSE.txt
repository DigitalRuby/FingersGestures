Fingers Gestures has a very simple but custom license.

You may use the source code in any free or commercial product with some restrictions:

- You may not sell or redistribute the source code itself as a product.
- Your product must not be primarily a touch / gesture product.
- Games, demos, etc. with touch controls are fine, but please do not resell as a touch / gesture package.

Thank you and please enjoy!

- Jeff Johnson
